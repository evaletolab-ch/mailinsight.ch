Open Source Guides (https://opensource.guide/) are a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open source project.

## Background
The first set of Open Source Guides were created and curated by GitHub, along with input from outside community reviewers, but they are not exclusive to GitHub products.

Our goal is to aggregate community best practices, *not* what GitHub (or any other individual or entity) thinks is best. Therefore, we try to use examples and quotations from others to illustrate our points.

**Open Source Guides are a resource and a discussion forum.** One reason we started this project is because we felt that there weren't enough resources for people creating open source projects. We made these guides open source in hopes that you'll use this space to talk about best practices, then document them when you've found consensus. We'd like this to be a safe space to talk about what's hard, what's scary, and what's simply confusing about running open source projects.

## Roadmap

We've shared our vision and priorities for this project in our [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).
